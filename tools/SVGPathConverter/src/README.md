This is a copy of [SVGPathConverter](https://github.com/HanSolo/SVGPathConverter), in the original example code the svg 
was designed to be used in a stack pane, In a "real world scenario" I would download a SVG from figma and I would need
to parse it into merged paths variables using a tool like gimp then paste one path at a time
